# Beet Code — Application Information Report

> Purpose: a precise, current description of BeetCode's structure,
> capabilities, key APIs, security model, test strategy, and known gaps —
> written so another agent (or engineer) can review, onboard, and improve
> the app without re-deriving everything from source.

> **Addendum (2026-08-19, v0.8):** since this report was written the app
> gained: the embedded GGUF/llama.cpp engine with KV-aware context admission
> (fixed 32 K clamp removed) and auto-enabled MTP speculative decoding; the
> left activity rail (panel toggles + new-chat) replacing the chat toolbar;
> Claude/Codex/Cursor chat-history import with live parser status and
> project-grouped collapsible sidebar headers; a Plugins settings tab;
> workspace-history digest in the system prompt; light/dark/beet themes with
> full-UI beet tint; local SmolVLM vision models in the catalog. Details in
> `README.md` (v0.8) and `docs/MTP-FEASIBILITY.md`; sections below describing
> the pre-v0.8 UI are historical.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-21, interoperability):** Cursor chat import now reads
> the current global `composerHeaders` + indexed composer/bubble records and
> retains the legacy workspace-database fallback. The Skills/Plugins settings
> surface discovers Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode,
> and Agent Skills conventions, including declarative skills inside plugin
> bundles. Users can connect any additional IDE/plugin folder; files stay in
> place and executable installers or hooks are never run during import.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-21, signing and device delivery):** Ship Center can use
> a valid Apple code-signing identity already held by macOS Keychain, create a
> signed iOS archive and IPA with current Xcode export methods, and install the
> finished app on a connected physical iPhone or iPad through `devicectl`.
> The composer provides a native setup sheet for certificate, provisioning,
> export, and device choices. Certificate passwords and private-key material
> never enter Beet Code; `.p12`/`.pfx` imports are handed to Keychain Access.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-21, history UX):** the sidebar now presents a compact
> `My chats` / `Other tools` switch with one shared search field. Imported
> conversations are grouped by project instead of vendor, carry clear Claude,
> Codex, Cursor, or bundle badges, and expose Import as the primary action only
> in the relevant view. Existing imports no longer trigger an automatic rescan
> every time the user revisits them.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-21, v0.9.4 native readiness):** a compact first-run
> assistant now connects the workspace and model, checks Apple Silicon,
> macOS, Xcode, Keychain signing identities, and connected devices, and offers
> direct recovery actions from empty states. Ship Center can additionally ask
> Xcode to upload an eligible iOS archive to App Store Connect. The full
> deterministic suite now executes 710 tests with 1 intentional skip and no
> failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-21, runtime capability map):** every agent prompt now
> places a compact, task-oriented capability map before the large tool-schema
> catalog. The map is generated from the exact per-session registry, includes
> connected MCP tools, remains present in memory-safe local mode, and never
> names unavailable sibling tools. Project instructions, policy, memory, and
> edit rules also precede bulky schemas so prompt fitting cannot silently
> discard them first. The full deterministic suite now executes 714 tests
> with 1 intentional skip and no failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, v0.9.5 release readiness):** encrypted session
> save failures are now surfaced and retained for retry; computer control is
> opt-in; Model Manager recommends chat and vision models for the Mac's chip
> and unified-memory tier; chat, sidebar, and settings code is split into
> focused components; and the app has launch-level accessibility smoke
> coverage. The verified suite executes 738 unit tests with 2 intentional
> opt-in skips plus 3 UI tests, with no failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, v0.9.6 chat-only mode):** Beet Code can run and
> restore conversations without a workspace. These sessions use a dedicated
> conversational prompt and expose no project context, file or command tools,
> MCP tools, hooks, memory, checkpoints, intelligence, or subagents. The
> verified suite executes 741 unit tests with 2 intentional skips plus 3 UI
> tests, with no failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, v0.9.7 answer readability):** assistant answers
> receive Markdown structure guidance and a display-only repair pass for
> missing paragraph boundaries, while fenced code remains unchanged. The
> completion card now starts a fresh chat directly, and Qwen3.5 9B 4-bit is
> classified as tight but allowed on an M4 Mac with 16 GB. The verified suite
> executes 743 unit tests with 2 intentional skips plus 3 UI tests.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, v0.9.8 Qwen3.5 compatibility):** unified
> Qwen3.5 text checkpoints whose tensors retain the `language_model.*`
> namespace are adapted at load time without copying their multi-gigabyte
> weights. The installed 9B abliterated 4-bit checkpoint was verified with a
> real load-and-generation smoke test on an M4 Mac with 16 GB. The suite now
> contains 744 unit tests plus 3 UI tests.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, experimental DFlash):** Settings > Agent now has an
> off-by-default DFlash switch for compatible Qwen3.5 9B GGUF targets. Beet
> Code caches a 766 MB Q4 draft locally, reserves its projected working set
> before choosing context size, and reports the acceleration actually loaded.
> Draft download, memory admission, or server failure falls back to embedded
> MTP and then standard decoding. A real Qwen3.5 9B generation passed on an M4
> Mac with 16 GB; the deterministic suite executes 753 tests with 4 intentional
> live skips and no failures. This uses DFlash v1 until a compatible 9B DFlash
> 2 checkpoint is published.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, local inference tuning):** every GGUF server now
> uses one slot (Beet Code serializes a single local user's generation) and
> explicitly retains prompt-prefix caching, avoiding the automatic four-slot
> KV reservation while preserving the full context window. Settings > Agent
> also offers off-by-default model-free n-gram speculation for GGUF models
> without DFlash/MTP. It uses llama.cpp's conservative `ngram-mod` defaults,
> reports its live state in the status bar, and falls back to standard decoding
> if unsupported. On the installed Qwen3.5 9B benchmark, a deterministic
> repeated-text response was identical at 27.8 tok/s versus 15.9 tok/s without
> n-gram speculation; the app-path live smoke also passed on Qwen2.5 7B.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, reversible MLX experiments):** Settings > Agent now
> exposes two independent, off-by-default MLX switches. Verified prompt reuse
> keeps an in-memory prefix only when the assistant echo exactly matches what
> MLX generated and another turn follows; mismatch, reset, compaction, memory
> pressure, or isolated replay clears it and returns to canonical full replay.
> KV8 quantizes eligible attention-cache entries after 512 tokens while leaving
> weights, model files, and chat history untouched. A pre-output failure retries
> once with standard KV and full replay; either switch can be disabled and the
> model reloaded to restore the previous path. On the installed Qwen3.5 9B
> 4-bit MLX checkpoint (native 262,144-token window), the deterministic test
> used 1,333 prompt tokens, then processed an identical continuation in 0.38 s
> and 18 new prompt tokens versus 7.05 s and 1,351 prompt tokens for full
> replay. Both produced exactly `CACHE_TWO`; decode measured 18.8 tok/s with
> caching and 17.5 tok/s with full replay. The
> deterministic suite executes 761 tests with 5 intentional live skips and no
> failures, and the opt-in real-model cache/KV8 smoke also passes.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, Qwen3.8 chat efficiency):** local GGUF chat-only
> requests now use llama.cpp's current per-request non-thinking control unless
> the user explicitly asks for deep reasoning. Output budgets of 512 tokens or
> less also force the visible-answer path, preventing a complete allowance from
> disappearing into hidden reasoning. Project-agent turns keep automatic
> reasoning. On Apple silicon, embedded MTP is no longer selected by default
> because its Metal verification overhead did not materially beat ordinary
> decoding on the installed Qwen3.8 9B Q5 model; an explicitly enabled
> ngram-mod experiment now takes priority even when the GGUF contains MTP.
> GGUF answers also consume llama-server's exact prompt/completion usage
> instead of counting network chunks as tokens. The suite executes 767 unit
> tests with 6 intentional live skips plus 3 UI tests, with no failures. On
> the same cached Qwen3.8 exact-answer request, automatic reasoning used 43
> completion tokens and 2.737 s; the non-thinking request used 4 tokens and
> 0.364 s with identical visible output. A real post-change Beet Code engine
> smoke returned the exact answer without a think block and reported exact
> usage. On a repeated-text benchmark, ngram-mod reached 21.0 tok/s versus
> 16.0 tok/s standard; MTP measured 16.1 tok/s.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, M4 16 GB efficiency pass):** the engine pool now
> accounts for the live physical footprint of out-of-process llama.cpp
> servers and evaluates the complete resident set before retaining another
> model. This keeps one Qwen3.8 9B Q5 model admissible on a clean 16 GB Mac
> while preventing a second large resident from forcing swap. Base M4 Macs
> with 16 GB use the measured llama.cpp batch profile of 1,024 logical and
> 256 physical tokens; a 2,048-token prompt benchmark improved from 183.4 to
> 193.8 prompt tok/s (+5.7%). Streaming transcript publication is limited to
> 20 Hz and Markdown repair/rendering to 10 Hz, while the final answer remains
> immediate and fully rendered. A real Qwen3.8 app-path smoke at an 8,192-token
> context returned exactly `QWEN38_FAST_OK` without a think block in 1.362 s,
> reporting 44 prompt and 8 completion tokens at 10.9 decode tok/s. The full
> verified suite executes 770 unit tests with 6 intentional live skips plus 3
> UI tests, with no failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, agent reliability v1):** project-agent sessions now
> advertise a task-scoped tool catalog while retaining the complete
> permission-filtered registry behind the executor. A representative
> fix-and-test task exposes 9 of the 36 available app tools (75% fewer schemas),
> reducing local-model prompt load and tool-choice ambiguity. Calls outside the
> routed set are rejected before approval or execution. GGUF sessions enable
> llama.cpp's native Jinja tool templates and pass the same routed schemas,
> with the existing no-tools retry retained for older servers. Three repeated
> malformed, bundled, or unavailable calls now end honestly without executing
> an action instead of consuming the entire turn budget. An opt-in live
> Qwen3.8 9B Q5 test at an 8,192-token context selected and executed
> `read_file`, consumed its result, and returned `VALUE_ALPHA` in 22.466 s
> after model load. The verified suite passes 776 unit tests with 7 intentional
> live skips plus 3 UI tests, with no failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, agent reliability v2):** every project-agent edit
> now creates verification debt. A completion claim automatically runs the
> detected project test/build, or `git diff --check` for a plain repository,
> and is rejected until the latest mutation generation passes. Unversioned
> folders report honestly when no automated checker exists. Successful
> mutations and changed paths are tracked, exact duplicate edits are not
> executed twice, and three identical failed actions terminate with a
> recoverable error instead of looping. Missing-file reads now produce typed
> failures. Context fitting retains the first objective plus newest work,
> preserves assistant/tool pairs, retries one provider-reported overflow, and
> project repair sessions proactively compact at 65% of usable context versus
> 75% for ordinary/chat sessions. A real Qwen3.8 9B Q5 run at 8,192 context
> completed read → write → real `swift test` → verified completion in 44.807 s;
> the broader initial tool surface did not finish within 180 s, confirming the
> benefit of constrained routing for this 9B model. The verified suite passes
> 778 unit tests with 8 intentional live skips plus 3 UI tests, with no
> failures.
>
> **Addendum (2026-08-22, semantic checkpoints and elastic memory):** automatic
> compaction and provider-overflow recovery now install their rebuilt history
> at complete semantic-turn boundaries. GGUF keeps the live llama.cpp slot and
> reuses only its exact unchanged prompt prefix; MLX clears its opaque KV state
> and performs a correctness-first replay because ChatSession cannot safely
> rewind to an arbitrary turn. On Macs with 24 GB or less, the generation
> safe-point governor trims disposable backend allocations at 35% context use,
> then evicts only idle resident models and trims again at 50% (or when usable
> headroom falls below the greater of 1 GB and 8% of physical memory). The
> active model, active KV, transcript, and durable task capsule are never
> discarded. An installed Qwen3.8 9B Q5 live test reduced a 320-sentence stable
> prefix continuation from 17.105 s full processing to 0.819 s after semantic
> rebase, with the exact expected answer. The deterministic suite executes 790
> tests: 781 passed, 9 intentional live skips, and 0 failures.
>
|> **Addendum (2026-08-19, prompt capability guidance):** the in-app browser
|> (README v0.6) and the simulator tools were registered but the system prompt
|> never told models WHEN to use them. `PromptBuilder.capabilityGuidance` now
|> derives its runtime map from the registered tool list: browser tools teach
|> an observe/action/verification loop; simulator tools teach `sim_build_run`
|> as the one-shot build → install → launch → screenshot → describe loop plus
|> the granular `sim_*` controls. Covered by
|> `Tests/PromptCapabilityGuidanceTests.swift`.
|>
|> **Addendum (2026-08-19, remaining-audit pass):** `glob` is an alias of
|> `find_files`; `web_fetch` is an approval-gated bounded HTTP GET; session
|> token/cost totals show in the status bar; `task` is a read-only nested
|> agent (8 turns, IsolatedReplayEngine so the parent conversation is not
|> reset). EnginePool holds up to 4 local models. See `docs/AUDIT-2026-08-19.md`
|> and `docs/COMPARISON.md`.

## 1. Identity

- **What**: native macOS (Apple Silicon only) coding agent that runs MLX
  models in-process (Metal) and/or remote BYOK providers, with a
  permission-gated tool loop, git checkpoints, durable encrypted sessions,
  long-term memory, an iOS Simulator panel with argent device tools, and a
  Cursor-style composer.
- **Stack**: Swift 6.0 (erasable syntax only), SwiftUI, macOS 15+ target,
  XcodeGen (project.yml), Swift Package Manager deps: mlx-swift-lm 3.31.4,
  mlx-swift 0.31.6, swift-transformers 1.3.3, swift-huggingface 0.9.0
  (pinned in BeetCode.xcodeproj/.../Package.resolved).
- **Targets**: `BeetCode` (app: App + Core), `BeetCodeCLI` (Core + CLI),
  `BeetCodeTests` (Tests, app-hosted).

## 2. Build / test

```sh
cd BeetCode
xcodegen generate                     # after adding/removing files
xcodebuild -project BeetCode.xcodeproj -scheme BeetCode \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .derived build
xcodebuild -project BeetCode.xcodeproj -scheme BeetCode \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .derived test
```

Current suite: **790 unit tests total: 781 passed, 9 intentional live-test skips, plus 3 UI tests; 0 failures**.
Tests never need model weights or Metal (FakeLLMEngine + FixtureHub).

## 4. Architecture & data flow

```
SwiftUI views → AppState (MainActor) → AgentSessionController → AgentLoop (actor)
                                                        │
              generate (LLMEngine) ← parse (ToolParser) ← gate (PermissionGate)
              execute (ToolExecutor) → tools (AgentTool) → Workspace/ShellRunner
              checkpoint (GitCheckpointer) · memory (AgentMemory) · persist (SessionStore)
```

- **Isolation**: AgentLoop is an actor; AppState/controllers are MainActor;
  engines are @unchecked Sendable classes with internal locks; MLX work is
  serialized by GenerationGate. Tools are Sendable structs; ToolContext is
  lock-protected.
- **Engine switch**: AppState holds `EngineRouter: LLMEngine`;
  `useRemote(RemoteEndpoint)` / `useLocal()` swap the delegate. The loop and
  UI never know which engine is active.
- **Events**: the loop yields an AsyncStream<AgentEvent> (taskStarted,
  tokenDelta, assistantMessage, toolCallStarted/Finished, awaitingApproval,
  askUser, checkpointCreated/Failed, protocolError, reasoning, planProposed,
  finished); the controller rebuilds the transcript; the stream is finished
  exactly once.
- **Sessions**: SessionRecord (messages, checkpoints, schemaVersion) persisted
  encrypted (AES-GCM, Keychain key cached in memory) with secret redaction;
  restore validates workspace + model; continuation seeds a new loop with
  history and checkpoints.

## 5. Capability inventory

| Capability | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local MLX inference | MLXEngine | GenerationGate-serialized Metal; MemoryAdvisor admission; thermal caps |
| BYOK remote engines | RemoteLLMEngine | OpenAI, DeepSeek, LongCat, Alibaba, Gemini, OpenRouter; SSE streaming |
| Tool loop | AgentLoop | one tool call per reply (protocol error otherwise); phase state machine; verification-before-completion gate |
| Permission gate | PermissionGate + CommandPolicy | reads auto; writes/commands approve; safe-command auto-approve |
| Workspace confinement | Workspace | realpath containment, symlink-safe, per-intent resolution |
| Shell execution | ShellRunner | process-group kill, sanitized env (no GIT_*), typed results |
| Git checkpoints/undo | GitCheckpointer + sidebar Undo | index preserved; GC refs; foreign-tree refusal |
| Sessions | SessionStore | encrypted, redacted, restore/continue, recent list |
| Memory | AgentMemory | facts + summaries, modes, keyword-ranked prompt injection |
| Compression | ContextCompactor | 3 levels; pairing preserved |
| Reasoning toggle | PromptBuilder + RemoteLLMClient | think blocks; reasoning_content folded |
| Plan mode | AgentLoop | plan → approve/revise → act |
| Diagnostics | BuildDiagnosticsTool | parsed, breadcrumb UI, post-edit verification (opt-in); failing verification refuses completion |
| Repo context | RepoIndex → PromptBuilder | bounded index + symbol summaries; task-ranked ordering |
| Vision | VisionTool | BYOK describe_image; SmolVLM seam documented |
| Simulator + argent | SimulatorController + sim_* tools | simctl panel + tap/type/describe/screenshot; sim_build_run one-shot loop |
| In-app browser | BrowserController + browser_* tools | agent-driven WKWebView; prompt teaches visual-verify loop |
| Composer | ChatView | attachments, expanding input, flow presets, paste |
| Thermal | ThermalMonitor | kernel + CPU-load proxy |
| CLI | BeetCodeCLI | status/download/generate |

## 6. Key APIs (for extenders)

### LLMEngine (Core/Inference/LLMEngine.swift)
`loadedModelID`, `stats`, `load(directory:modelID:diskBytes:)`,
`unload()`, `reset()`, `stream(adding: [ChatTurn], maxTokens: Int?,
temperature: Double?) -> AsyncThrowingStream<String, Error>`,
`cancelGeneration()`; defaults: `clearCaches()`, `dumpIfResident()`.

### AgentTool (Core/Tools/AgentTool.swift)
`name`, `summary`, `risk: ToolRisk (read/write/execute)`, `schemaText`,
`preview(_ call:in:) -> ApprovalPreview`, `execute(_ call:in: ToolContext)
async throws -> String`. Optionally conform to `CommandExecuting` for typed
command results.

### AgentLoop public surface
`run(userMessage:) -> AsyncStream<AgentEvent>` (rejects concurrent runs),
`resolve(requestID:approved:)`, `answerQuestion(requestID:text:)`,
`resolvePlan(approved:)`, `cancel()`, `sessionRecord`. Configuration:
maxTurns, maxTokensPerTurn, temperature, checkpointingEnabled,
contextWindowTokens, thermalTokenCeiling, verifyAfterEdits, showReasoning,
planMode, memoryMode, compressionLevel.

### ToolExecutor
`execute(_ call:) -> Outcome(output, failed, exitCode?)`; rejects duplicate
tool registration (precondition).

### Workspace
`resolve(_ path:, access: .read/.write/.enumerate) throws -> WorkspacePath`;
`resolvingSymlinks` (realpath-based, /private/var-consistent).

### Persistence
`SessionStore`: save/load(id:)/loadAll/delete/validateWorkspaceBinding/
currentSessionID, redactAndBound. `AppPreferencesStore`: current/save/
validatedWorkspaceURL/bookmarkData. `SettingsStore`: keys below.

## 7. Security model

- **Confinement**: canonical realpath containment; symlinked roots/parents
  rejected or resolved; sibling-prefix safe; per-intent resolution;
  resolved URLs reused between preview and execution.
- **Shell**: safe-command auto-approve only for exact executables with
  in-workspace paths; operators/substitution/redirection/backgrounding and
  outside paths always ask; sanitized environment (GIT_* stripped);
  process-group SIGKILL on timeout/cancel.
- **Checkpoints**: sanitized git env, foreign-tree refusal, index
  preservation, symlink-safe cleanup, GC retention refs.
- **Secrets**: Keychain only (HF token, provider keys, session key),
  in-memory caches, session payload redaction (hf_/ghp_/sk-/Bearer/etc.),
  private file permissions (0700/0600).
- **Approval**: the UI cannot bypass the gate; control tools are loop-
  intercepted; verification builds never run silently.

## 8. Settings reference (SettingsStore keys)

autoApproveEdits, autoApproveCommands, maxTurns, maxTokensPerTurn,
temperature, checkpointingEnabled, verifyAfterEdits, memoryMode,
compressionLevel, composerFlow, showReasoning, planMode,
experimentalDFlashEnabled, experimentalNGramEnabled,
experimentalMLXPromptCacheEnabled, experimentalMLXQuantizedKVEnabled.
AppPreferences (JSON): lastWorkspacePath (+bookmark), lastModelID,
lastSessionID, autoResumeDownloads, remoteModel[provider].

## 9. Test strategy

- **FakeLLMEngine**: scripted responses, turn-history recording, held
  streams for deterministic cancellation — AgentLoop tests need no weights.
- **EventCollector**: async event assertions with deadlines.
- **TempWorkspace/GitRepo**: real fs/git fixtures, auto-cleaned.
- **FixtureHub**: local file downloads through the real downloader path
  (HubServing protocol seam).
- **Suites**: AgentLoopTests (20), AgentTests (tools/policy/git/workspace),
  BYOKTests, DiagnosticParserTests, ReasoningTests, MemoryTests,
  PersistenceTests, RepoIndexTests, EndToEndTests (AppState→download→agent),
  SmartDownloaderTests, MemoryAdvisorTests, ToolParserTests, DiffEngineTests.

## 10. Known gaps & improvement candidates

From docs/COMPARISON.md (vs OpenCode/OpenClaude) and the harness audit:

- MCP client support (deferred in v0.2; highest-value ecosystem gap).
- Subagents (task tool with bounded child loops).
- AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md project-memory convention.
- Hooks (PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop) and slash commands.
- Web-fetch tool; side-by-side diff viewer; cost/token tracking; session
  share/export; glob tool; keybind customization; declarative config file.
- Vision: local SmolVLM engine behind VisionProvider once mlx-swift-lm ships
  VLM support (track mlx-swift-examples PR #206).
- Technical debt: `describeImage` uses a semaphore bridge (bounded 15s) —
  could become async when the composer send path is async; SettingsView/
  ModelManagerView carry UI-heavy state that could move to view models.

## 11. Conventions for contributors

1. **Add a tool**: implement AgentTool (schemaText as JSON, risk honest),
   register in AgentSessionController.defaultTools; reads auto-run, writes/
   executes get approval cards; checkpoint-before-mutation is automatic for
   `.write` and mutating commands.
2. **Add a setting**: SettingsStore key + default registration + SettingsView
   section; pass into AgentLoop.Configuration.
3. **Add an engine**: conform to LLMEngine; plug into EngineRouter.
4. **Tests**: deterministic; fake the network (FixtureHub/HubServing) and the
   model (FakeLLMEngine); use TempWorkspace, never real user dirs.
5. **After adding files**: `xcodegen generate` (project.yml is the source of
   truth).
6. **Swift style**: erasable syntax only (no enums-with-associated-value
   issues — plain enums fine), NSLock usage must stay in sync helpers
   (async contexts forbid lock()/unlock()), no literal backticks in
   comments if generated by tooling.

## 12. External integrations

- **argent** (`argent run <tool> --args <json> --json`): sim_* tools;
  banner-tolerant JSON parsing in Summarize.
- **xcrun simctl**: boot/install/launch/screenshot stream.
- **Hugging Face Hub**: downloads with ETag/sidecar resume, Keychain token.
- **Providers**: OpenAI-compatible SSE + Gemini native streaming.

Generated 2026-08-17. Suite: 142 tests green (v0.4: P0 hardening + P1 agent-competitiveness pass).
