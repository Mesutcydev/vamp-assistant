/// Live, mid-run approval overrides for the PermissionGate.
///
/// When the user taps "Always approve" on an approval card, the decision
/// must take effect IMMEDIATELY — the running agent loop already holds a
/// `PermissionGate` value, so a settings change alone would only apply to
/// the next run. This lock-guarded reference is created per run, handed to
/// both the gate (read side) and the controller (write side), and consulted
/// before the static gate flags.
///
/// Safety posture is unchanged: overrides only ever WIDEN approval within
/// the two explicit categories (file edits / policy-safe commands). Reads,
/// plan approval, and the command allowlist policy are untouched — a
/// blanket shell bypass remains impossible because the gate still requires
/// `policy.safeForAutoApproval` for commands.
