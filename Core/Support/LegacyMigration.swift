/// - Keychain items are COPIED old service → new service (same raw bytes —
///   session files decrypt identically because the key value is unchanged).

///   exists and the new one does not.
/// - Fully idempotent; safe to call on every launch.
/// - Never runs under XCTest (tests use deterministic in-memory seams).
